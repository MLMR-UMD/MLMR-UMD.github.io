# The International IRMI Competition
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IRMI: Industry-Relevant Materials Informatics

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Description
Each competition is designed with industry partners to ensure industry relevance. We aim to make each competition as accessible as possible - ensuring that even competitors new to AI can make significant contributions.
IRMI is run by the Machine Learning and Materials Research (MLMR) Organization, a collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Maryland.
For any questions, please contact: mlmr@umd.edu

## Competitions
*** Under Construction ***
When complete, this website will provide visitors the opportunity to compete in all competitions (whether past or present), with a live score board. We will list all previous winners and their innovations.

### AI for Neutron Scattering and Phase Mapping (Originally held 2024)
Build an AI agent to explore the phase map of a 3-component (ternary) molecular formulation. The goal is for your agent to identify the phase map with the minumum number of experiments.
For each experiment, you 1) determine how much of the 3 components to mix together and then 2) characterize the molecular structure of the resulting mixture using neutron scattering simulation.

### AI for Battery Protocol Optimization (Originally held 2022)
Battery life depends not only on capacity, but also the battery's useage history.
Build a model that can accurately predict the remaining useful life of old batteries based on capacity and useage history.

### Optimizing a Phase-Dependent Functional Property (Originally held 2021)
Industry-relevant properties (also known as 'functional' properties along with 'structural' properties) tend to depend on the lattice structures and microstructures present in a materials.
As a result, optimal materials tend to occur within specific phase regions or near phase boundaries of a composition-phase map. Additionally, the target property may have different behavior in different regions of the composition-phase map due to structure dependency.
This challenge asks competitors to identify the material with the maximum target property (here given as a scalar quantity), knowing that the target property may be a complicated function of composition.
